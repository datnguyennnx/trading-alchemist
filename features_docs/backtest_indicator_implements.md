### Recently Implemented

The following indicators have been recently implemented or significantly enhanced:

1. **Projection Bands** - Volatility-based bands for identifying potential price targets and reversal zones
2. **NVI/PVI (Negative/Positive Volume Index)** - Volume-based indicators designed to identify "smart money" activity
3. **Basic Volume Analysis** - Essential volume analysis functions for market analysis
4. **Channels** - Multiple implementations including Linear Regression, Raff, Parallel, Trend, and Envelope Channels
5. **Ultimate Oscillator** - Momentum oscillator using multiple timeframes to reduce false signals
6. **Simple Momentum** - Basic momentum calculation for measuring rate of price change
7. **Klinger Oscillator** - Volume-based indicator comparing volume to price to identify long-term money flow trends and reversals
8. **TSI (True Strength Index)** - Double-smoothed momentum oscillator for trend direction and overbought/oversold conditions
9. **Fractals** - Bill Williams' indicator for identifying potential reversal points and market structure
10. **Chaikin Volatility** - Measures the rate of change of the trading range to identify potential market reversals
11. **EOM (Ease of Movement)** - Volume-based oscillator for measuring the ease of price movement

### Implementation Priorities

All proposed indicators have now been implemented! The next priorities should be:

1. Add comprehensive unit tests for all indicators
2. Improve the Volatility Ratio indicator (currently marked as partial)
3. Create indicator combination modules (e.g., combining multiple indicators for trading signals)
4. Improve performance for large datasets
5. Add visualization helpers for LiveView display of indicators

## Technical Improvements

All implemented indicators follow these best practices:

1. **Functional Programming**: Pure functions with no side effects
2. **Pattern Matching**: Extensive use of Elixir pattern matching for parameter validation
3. **Pipeline Operations**: Elixir pipe operator for clear data transformations
4. **Error Handling**: Proper handling of edge cases (nil values, division by zero)
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation with parameter descriptions and return values
6. **Consistent Return Format**: Standardized {:ok, result} and {:error, reason} return tuples
7. **Signal Generation**: Advanced signal generation and divergence detection functions
8. **Multi-timeframe Analysis**: Support for analyzing indicators across multiple timeframes
9. **Market Structure Recognition**: Functions for identifying market structure and patterns

## Future Work

1. Complete comprehensive unit tests for all indicators
2. Create indicator combination modules (e.g., combining multiple indicators for trading signals)
3. Improve performance for large datasets
4. Add visualization helpers for LiveView display of indicators
5. Implement machine learning enhanced indicator modules
6. Add adaptive indicator variations that adjust parameters based on market conditions

## Testing Strategy

To ensure the reliability of these indicators, we recommend:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test each indicator with known input/output pairs from external references
2. **Property Tests**: Verify mathematical properties that must be true regardless of input values
3. **Performance Tests**: Ensure indicators can handle large datasets efficiently
4. **Integration Tests**: Test indicators in combination with other system components
5. **Edge Case Tests**: Verify correct behavior with missing data, extreme values, etc.
